${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- JRebel Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects from SCM

Note that Eclipse may give errors on pom.xml. This is due to Eclipse m2e wtp not fully supporting all used Maven plugins used. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Debugging server-side

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes more reliable. Just add JRebel nature to your project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, start the project with Run > Debug configurations... 
Create a new Maven Build configuration for "package jetty:run". If you have JRebel, also enable that from the JRebel tab. After you run it, you can access the demo application at http://localhost:8080/ and make code modifications on the server-side classes and SCSS files on the fly.

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Debugging client-side

The most common way of debugging and making changes to the client-side code is dev-mode. To run it, create another Maven Build configuration for "vaadin:run" target. When it is launched, it opens up GWT dev-mode where you can debug client-side code in regular Java.

Another way of debugging client-side is super dev-mode. To enable it, take a look at WidgetSet.gwt.xml for instructions.
